# ECS Audio Processing Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from on-demand ECS tasks to an always-running ECS service with SQS queue integration.

## Changes Made

### 1. CloudFormation Template Updates (`ecsAudioProcessing-cloudformation-template.json`)
- **Added SQS Resources:**
  - `AudioProcessingQueue`: Main processing queue with 15-minute visibility timeout
  - `AudioProcessingDLQ`: Dead letter queue for failed messages
  
- **Added ECS Service:**
  - Service runs continuously with 1 container minimum
  - Configured for Fargate launch type
  - Health check grace period of 60 seconds
  
- **Added Auto-scaling:**
  - Scales from 1 to 10 containers based on SQS queue depth
  - Target: 10 messages per container
  - Scale-out cooldown: 60 seconds
  - Scale-in cooldown: 300 seconds
  
- **Updated IAM Policies:**
  - Changed Lambda policy from ECS RunTask to SQS SendMessage
  - Added SQS permissions to ECS Task Role for polling/deleting messages
  
- **Added Environment Variables to Container:**
  - `SQS_QUEUE_URL`: Queue URL for polling
  - `PROCESSING_MODE`: Set to "service" for continuous operation

### 2. Audio Processor Updates (`audio_processor.py`)
- Added `run_sqs_polling_loop()` function for continuous message processing
- Implemented graceful shutdown handling (SIGTERM)
- Modified `main()` to support both "task" and "service" modes
- Service mode polls SQS with 20-second long polling
- Automatically deletes messages after successful processing

### 3. Entrypoint Script Updates (`entrypoint.sh`)
- Added processing mode detection
- Different validation for service vs task mode
- Service mode validates SQS_QUEUE_URL instead of individual S3 parameters

### 4. Lambda Function Updates (`CreateSampleRecord/src/index.js`)
- Removed ECS task launching code
- Added SQS message sending
- Changed status from "PROCESSING" to "QUEUED"
- Removed ECS-specific validation and configuration lookup
- Simplified error handling for SQS failures

### 5. CloudFormation Outputs Added
- `AudioProcessingQueueUrl`: URL for the main queue
- `AudioProcessingQueueArn`: ARN for the main queue
- `AudioProcessingDLQUrl`: URL for the dead letter queue

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Eliminated cold starts**: Processing now starts within 1 second vs 30-60 seconds
2. **Better scalability**: Auto-scales based on actual queue depth
3. **Improved reliability**: SQS provides automatic retries and DLQ for failures
4. **Cost optimization**: Scales down to 1 container during low usage

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Build and push updated Docker image to ECR
2. Deploy CloudFormation changes with `amplify push`
3. Monitor service startup and queue processing
4. Verify auto-scaling behavior under load

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Change `PROCESSING_MODE` environment variable back to "task"
2. Revert Lambda function to use ECS RunTask
3. Service will continue running but won't process messages
4. Can then safely remove service and SQS resources
