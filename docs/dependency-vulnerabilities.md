## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **Audio Recording**: expo-av API changes may break recording functionality
2. **AWS Integration**: Amplify v6 has significant API changes
3. **Navigation**: React Navigation updates may affect app flow
4. **Platform Support**: Minimum OS versions will increase

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Feature Flags**: Implement gradual rollout
2. **Rollback Plan**: Tag stable version before updates
3. **Testing Protocol**: 
   - Unit tests for critical functions
   - Integration tests for AWS services
   - E2E tests for user flows
   - Manual testing on iOS/Android devices

## Testing Checklist

### Pre-Update Testing
- [ ] Document current app functionality
- [ ] Record test scenarios for:
  - [ ] User registration/login
  - [ ] Audio recording
  - [ ] Audio playback

- [ ] Authentication flows
  - [ ] Sign up with email verification
  - [ ] Sign in
  - [ ] Password reset
  - [ ] Token refresh
- [ ] Audio features
  - [ ] Recording permissions
  - [ ] Recording quality
  - [ ] Playback functionality
  - [ ] Background audio (iOS)
- [ ] Data operations
  - [ ] Create new recordings
  - [ ] List recordings
  - [ ] Delete recordings
  - [ ] Real-time subscriptions
- [ ] Platform-specific
  - [ ] iOS simulator
  - [ ] iOS device
  - [ ] Android emulator
  - [ ] Android device
  - [ ] Web (if applicable)

## Rollback Procedures

1. **Git Tags**: Create tags before each major update
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0-pre-security-update -m "Before security updates"
   ```

2. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Full project backup
   - Database export
   - S3 bucket snapshot

3. **Rollback Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous tag
   git checkout v1.0-pre-security-update
   
   # Restore dependencies
   npm ci
   
   # Restore AWS backend
   amplify pull --restore
   ```

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Weekly: `npm audit` checks
   - Monthly: Minor version updates
   - Quarterly: Major version assessments

2. **Automated Monitoring**:
   - GitHub Dependabot alerts
   - npm audit in CI/CD pipeline
   - Security scanning in PR checks

3. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain upgrade log
   - Document custom patches
   - Track breaking changes

## Package Manager Cleanup

**Issue**: Both `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` exist
**Resolution**: 
1. Choose npm as primary (has more recent lock file)
2. Remove yarn.lock
3. Run `npm ci` to ensure clean install

## Conclusion

This security update requires careful planning and execution due to the significant version jumps in core dependencies. The phased approach minimizes risk while ensuring all vulnerabilities are addressed. Priority should be given to critical vulnerabilities while planning for the larger framework updates.
