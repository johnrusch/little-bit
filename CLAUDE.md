# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Common Development Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start Expo development server
npm start

# Run on specific platforms
npm run ios      # iOS Simulator
npm run android  # Android Emulator
npm run web      # Web browser
```

### AWS Amplify Commands
```bash
# Initialize Amplify (first-time setup)
amplify init

# Deploy backend changes
amplify push

# Pull latest backend configuration
amplify pull

# Check Amplify status
amplify status
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Clear Expo cache (for build issues)
expo start -c

# Install specific Expo packages
expo install [package-name]
```

### Package Manager Policy
**This project uses npm exclusively.** Do not use yarn to avoid lockfile conflicts.

```bash
# ✅ Correct - Use npm
npm install           # Install dependencies
npm install package   # Add new dependency
npm audit fix         # Fix vulnerabilities

# ❌ Avoid - Do not use yarn
yarn install          # Creates conflicting yarn.lock
yarn add package      # Mixed package managers
```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo (managed workflow)
- **Backend**: AWS Amplify with GraphQL API
- **Audio**: Expo AV for recording and playback
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6

### AWS Services Integration
The app heavily relies on AWS Amplify for backend services:
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito user pools
- **API**: GraphQL with AWS AppSync (schema at `amplify/backend/api/littlebit/schema.graphql`)
- **Storage**: S3 for audio files (configured in `amplify/backend/storage/`)
- **Database**: DynamoDB (managed through GraphQL)
- **Functions**: Lambda functions in `amplify/backend/function/`
  - `CreateSampleRecord` (Node.js): Creates database records
  - `EditandConvertRecordings` (Python 3.8): Processes audio files

### Key Application Flows

1. **Audio Recording Flow**:
   - User initiates recording in `RecorderScreen`
   - Audio captured using Expo AV APIs
   - Recording saved to S3 via Amplify Storage
   - Metadata stored in DynamoDB via GraphQL mutation

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Managed by `UserContext` using AWS Cognito
   - Sign up includes email verification
   - Protected routes require authentication

3. **Data Flow**:
   - GraphQL subscriptions for real-time updates
   - Optimistic UI updates for better UX
   - S3 presigned URLs for secure audio access

### Critical Files and Patterns

- **API Services** (`src/api/`): Encapsulate Amplify operations
  - `authService.js`: Cognito authentication wrapper
  - `playbackService.js`: Audio playback management
  - `soundsService.js`: CRUD operations for audio samples

- **GraphQL Operations** (`src/graphql/`): Auto-generated by Amplify
  - Mutations, queries, and subscriptions for Sample model
  - Custom resolvers may be in `amplify/backend/api/littlebit/resolvers/`

- **Screen Components**: Each screen in `src/screens/` is self-contained
  - Use hooks from `src/hooks/` for shared logic
  - Import reusable components from `src/components/`

### Development Considerations

1. **Permissions**: Audio recording requires microphone permissions (handled automatically by Expo)

2. **Platform Differences**: 
   - Web platform has limited audio features
   - iOS requires special handling for silent mode (`playsInSilentMode`)

3. **AWS Configuration**:
   - `src/aws-exports.js` is auto-generated and contains sensitive config
   - Never commit AWS credentials or modify aws-exports.js manually

4. **Model Changes**: 
   - GraphQL schema changes require `amplify push` to update
   - This regenerates models in `src/models/`

5. **State Management**:
   - UserContext provides global auth state
   - Local component state for UI interactions
   - No Redux or MobX - keep state management simple

### Testing and Code Quality

**Current Status**: 
- Jest and React Native Testing Library configured for unit and component testing
- Test coverage reporting with CodeCov integration
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing on PRs
- No linting rules beyond basic `.eslintignore`
- No TypeScript setup

**Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests for CI/CD
npm run test:ci
```

**Testing Structure**:
- Tests are located in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the code they test
- Test files should follow the naming convention: `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`
- Jest configuration is in `jest.config.js`
- Test setup and mocks are in `jest.setup.js`

**Writing Tests**:
```javascript
// Example component test
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import MyComponent from '../MyComponent';

test('should handle user interaction', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<MyComponent />);
  fireEvent.press(getByText('Button'));
  expect(getByText('Result')).toBeTruthy();
});
```

**Mocking Guidelines**:
- AWS Amplify services are pre-mocked in `jest.setup.js`
- Expo AV (audio) modules are mocked for testing
- React Navigation hooks are mocked
- Use `jest.mock()` for additional module mocking as needed

**Coverage Goals**:
- Target 80%+ code coverage for new features
- Coverage reports are generated in `/coverage` directory
- View HTML coverage report: `open coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Development Issues

1. **Metro Bundler Problems**:
   ```bash
   # Clear all caches
   npx expo start -c
   
   # Reset everything
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npx expo start -c
   ```

2. **AWS Amplify Sync Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Pull latest backend config
   amplify pull --restore
   
   # Check backend status
   amplify status
   
   # View function logs
   amplify logs
   ```

3. **Audio Recording Issues**:
   - iOS: Check Settings > Privacy > Microphone
   - Android: Verify permissions in app settings
   - Web: HTTPS required for microphone access

### Security Considerations

- **Vulnerabilities**: Check `/docs/dependency-vulnerabilities.md` for known issues
- **AWS Credentials**: Never commit credentials - use `aws-exports.js` (auto-generated)
- **Environment Variables**: Currently not used, but would go in `.env` files

### Project Structure Details

#### Key Configuration Files
- `/metro.config.js` - Excludes Amplify cloud backend from bundling
- `/babel.config.js` - Uses Expo preset
- `/src/amplifyconfiguration.json` - Amplify service configuration
- `/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` - Template for bug reports

#### CI/CD Workflows
- `.github/workflows/claude.yml` - Claude Code AI assistant
- `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` - Automated PR reviews
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Automated test suite runs on PRs and pushes

### Expo-Specific Tips

```bash
# Run on specific port
npx expo start --port 8081

# Open developer menu
# iOS Simulator: Cmd + D
# Android Emulator: Cmd + M

# Install Expo-compatible versions
expo install [package-name]  # Ensures compatibility
```

### Version Requirements

- **Node.js**: 14+ (recommend 18+ LTS)
- **Expo SDK**: 53 (latest)
- **React Native**: 0.79.5
- **AWS Amplify**: v6 (migrated from v4)

### Development Best Practices

1. **Before Committing**:
   - Run `npm audit` for security checks
   - Ensure no AWS credentials in code
   - Test on both iOS and Android if possible

2. **When Adding Dependencies**:
   - Use `npm install` (not yarn)
   - Use `expo install` for Expo-compatible packages
   - Update `package-lock.json`

3. **GraphQL Schema Changes**:
   - Edit schema in `amplify/backend/api/littlebit/schema.graphql`
   - Run `amplify push` to deploy changes
   - This regenerates TypeScript models in `src/models/`
