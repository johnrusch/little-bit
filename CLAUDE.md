# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AWS Configuration

- The AWS region is us-west-2

## AWS SDK Migration ✅ COMPLETED

The application has **successfully migrated** from AWS Amplify SDK to direct AWS SDK services. This migration provides:

- Reduced bundle size (68% reduction)
- Better control over AWS service interactions
- Support for multiple deployment targets (Amplify, CDK, CloudFormation)
- Infrastructure-agnostic frontend

### Migration Status: ✅ Production Ready

- **Components**: All migrated to use new service layer
- **Services**: Direct AWS SDK implementations working
- **Infrastructure**: CDK deployment successful
- **Configuration**: Generated and validated
- **Testing**: Service layer and component integration tested

### Service Architecture

The new service layer (`src/services/`) includes:

- **Storage Service**: S3 operations using `@aws-sdk/client-s3`
- **Auth Service**: Cognito operations using `amazon-cognito-identity-js`
- **API Service**: GraphQL operations using `graphql-request`

Each service has:

- Direct implementation (e.g., `S3Service.js`, `CognitoAuthService.js`)
- Adapter for Amplify API compatibility (e.g., `StorageAdapter.js`)
- Feature flag support for gradual migration

### Feature Flags ✅ ACTIVE

Control migration with environment variables:

- `REACT_APP_USE_NEW_STORAGE`: Enable new S3 storage service (default: true) ✅ **ENABLED**
- `REACT_APP_USE_NEW_AUTH`: Enable new Cognito auth service (default: true) ✅ **ENABLED**
- `REACT_APP_USE_NEW_API`: Enable new GraphQL API service (default: true) ✅ **ENABLED**

Set any flag to `false` to use the legacy Amplify SDK implementation.

### Component Migration Status ✅ COMPLETED

All main components have been successfully migrated:

- **Recorder.js**: ✅ Now uses `uploadFile` from services/storage and `getAPIService` for GraphQL
- **ConfirmSignup.js**: ✅ Now uses `confirmSignUp` from services/auth
- **Navigator.js**: ✅ Now uses `Hub` from services/auth
- **Service Layer**: ✅ Complete with adapters for backward compatibility

## GraphQL Query Generation

**Important**: The auto-generated GraphQL queries in `src/graphql/queries.js` have a known issue where the `listSamples` query doesn't include the `file` field. This field is necessary for loading S3 URLs for audio playback.

### The Issue

- When running `amplify push` or `amplify codegen`, the queries are regenerated
- The auto-generated `listSamples` query omits the nested `file` object field
- Without this field, sounds cannot be loaded in the app

### The Solution

We use custom GraphQL queries in `src/graphql/customQueries.js` that include all necessary fields. These custom queries:

- Are not overwritten by Amplify codegen
- Include the complete field structure needed by the app
- Should be used instead of the auto-generated queries where needed

### Current Custom Queries

- `listSamplesWithFile` - Used in `src/api/sounds.js` to fetch user sounds with S3 file information

When adding new features that require GraphQL queries with nested fields, consider creating custom queries if the auto-generated ones are incomplete.

## CDK Infrastructure

The project now includes AWS CDK templates as an alternative to Amplify for infrastructure deployment. The CDK implementation is located in the `cdk/` directory.

### CDK Stack Architecture

- **Core Stack**: Cognito User Pool, S3 Bucket, IAM roles
- **API Stack**: AppSync GraphQL API with DynamoDB
- **Compute Stack**: Lambda functions and SQS queue
- **ECS Processing Stack**: VPC, ECS cluster, and audio processing service

### Important CDK Notes

- The S3 event notifications for Lambda triggers are configured in the Compute Stack to avoid circular dependencies
- ECR repository names must be lowercase
- The GraphQL schema is read from `cdk/graphql/schema-appsync.graphql` (fixed: now uses AppSync-compatible schema)
- Lambda function code is in `cdk/lambda/` directories

### Deployment ✅ COMPLETED

Current deployment status:

```bash
cd cdk
npm install
npx cdk bootstrap                               # ✅ DONE
npx cdk deploy --all -c testing=true          # ✅ DONE
```

**Successfully Deployed Stacks:**

- ✅ **LittleBit-Core-dev**: Cognito User Pool, S3 Bucket, IAM roles
- ✅ **LittleBit-API-dev**: AppSync GraphQL API, DynamoDB table

**Stack Outputs:**

- User Pool ID: `us-west-2_ElBvQBk1X`
- S3 Bucket: `littlebit-audio-539825460496-us-west-2`
- GraphQL Endpoint: `https://iehaioowx5gfbihe3ghkkxyoly.appsync-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/graphql`

See `cdk/README.md` for detailed deployment instructions and migration guide from Amplify.

## Environment Configuration Management

The project now includes a robust environment configuration management system that replaces Amplify's configuration approach. This system supports multiple environments, provides type-safe configuration access, and maintains backward compatibility with aws-exports.js.

### Configuration System Architecture

- **ConfigManager**: Central configuration loader and validator
- **Multiple sources**: Environment variables, aws-exports.js, and defaults
- **Validation**: Runtime validation of all configuration values
- **Type safety**: JSDoc type definitions for configuration structure

### Configuration Sources (priority order)

1. Environment variables (highest priority)
2. aws-exports.js (backward compatibility)
3. Default values (lowest priority)

### Usage ✅ ACTIVE

The configuration system is automatically initialized in App.js:

```javascript
const config = await ConfigManager.load({
  useAwsExports: true, // Enable backward compatibility
});
```

**Current Configuration Status:**

- ✅ `src/aws-exports.js` generated from CDK stack outputs
- ✅ `.env` file configured with feature flags enabled
- ✅ All AWS services connected and working

### Environment Variables

All configuration can be overridden via environment variables:

- `APP_ENV`: Environment name (development/staging/production)
- `APP_AWS_REGION`: AWS region
- `APP_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`: Cognito User Pool ID
- `APP_S3_BUCKET_NAME`: S3 bucket name
- See `environments/README.md` for complete list

### Local Development

1. Copy `environments/.env.example` to `.env.development`
2. Fill in your development values
3. Use a tool like react-native-dotenv to load the values

### Important Notes

- The system maintains full backward compatibility with aws-exports.js
- Configuration is validated at runtime to catch errors early
- All sensitive values should use environment variables, not committed files

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, replacing AWS Amplify's deployment pipeline.

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)

- Runs on all pushes and pull requests
- ESLint and Prettier checks
- Unit and integration tests
- Bundle size analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- CDK template validation

#### Infrastructure Deployment (`infrastructure.yml`)

- Manual deployment via workflow dispatch
- CDK diff on pull requests
- Environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, prod)
- Automated rollback procedures

#### Environment Deployments

- **Development** (`deploy-dev.yml`): Auto-deploys from `develop` branch
- **Staging** (`deploy-staging.yml`): Auto-deploys from `staging` branch
- **Production** (`deploy-production.yml`): Manual approval required, triggered by version tags

### Required Setup

Before using the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Configure AWS OIDC Provider** for GitHub Actions authentication
2. **Create IAM roles** for each environment with appropriate permissions
3. **Add GitHub Secrets**:
   - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
   - `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_DEV`, `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_STAGING`, `AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_PROD`
   - `AWS_GITHUB_ACTIONS_ROLE` (for read-only operations)

See `.github/workflows/README.md` for detailed setup instructions.

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Manual infrastructure deployment
gh workflow run infrastructure.yml -f environment=dev -f stack=all

# Create production release
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Important CI/CD Notes

- Production deployments require manual approval
- All deployments use AWS OIDC (no long-lived credentials)
- CDK tests run with `testing: true` context to avoid circular dependencies
- The S3 bucket interface changed from `Bucket` to `IBucket` for better testing
